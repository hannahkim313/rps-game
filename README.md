# Rock Paper Scissors

## Project Summary

This project exercise, created by The Odin Project, is a simple program of rock paper scissors that is played through the browser console. In the future, a GUI will be added and updated in this README.md, respectively. This project will demonstrate my ability to implement basic functions in JavaScript while creating a program from scratch.
