# Rock Paper Scissors

https://hannahkim313.github.io/rps-game/

## Project Summary

This project exercise, created by The Odin Project, is a simple program of
rock paper scissors in which the user plays against the computer. The game ends
when either the user or the computer reaches 5 points, which is determined by
the following rules:

* Rock beats scissors
* Paper beats rock
* Scissors beats paper
* The same move results in a draw

This project will demonstrate my ability to create a program from scratch by not
only working with HTML and CSS but also with event listeners and DOM manipulation
using JavaScript.
