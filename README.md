# Rock Paper Scissors

## Project Summary

This project exercise, created by The Odin Project, is a simple program of
rock paper scissors in which the user plays against the computer. The game ends
when a player reaches 5 points and is determined by the following rules:

* Rock beats scissors
* Paper beats rock
* Scissors beats paper
* The same move results in a draw

This project will demonstrate my ability to create a program from scratch by
working with the DOM in JavaScript.
